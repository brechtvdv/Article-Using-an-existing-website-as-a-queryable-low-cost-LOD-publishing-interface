##  Conclusion
{:#conclusion}

Data owners can publish their LOD very cost-efficient on their website with JSON-LD snippets. After an initial cost of adding this feature to their website, they can have an always up-to-date dataset with negligible maintenance costs, however, machine clients that query and harvest over websites can introduce unforeseen spikes of activity. Data owners will need to extend their monitoring capabilities to not only focus on human interaction (e.g. Google Analytics) and apply a HTTP caching strategy for stale resources.

Linked Data services ([HDT](cite:cites Fernndez2013BinaryRR) file, TPF interface...) with a higher maintenance cost can be created on top of JSON-LD snippets, but these would suffer from scalability problems: OCR texts have bad compression rates, and thus require gigabytes of disk space. With our solution, these OCR texts are published in a seperate document keeping the maintenance cost low while harvesting in an automated way is still possible. 

<!--  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach? How can the work be compared with others? What are the differences to other cultural heritage LODs like e.g. Europeana?  -->
The LOD interfaces of the European cultural heritage platform Europeana take an opposite approach from this work: every [subject page](https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2022608/NTM_NTM_UWP_23476.html) contains a title and description annotation for SEO, but the actual machine-readable data is exposed through a seperate record [API](https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/record/2022608/NTM_NTM_UWP_23476.json-ld?wskey=XXX) with API key protection and publicly available [SPARQL](http://sparql.europeana.eu/?default-graph-uri=&query=PREFIX+dc%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fdc%2Felements%2F1.1%2F%3E%0D%0APREFIX+edm%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.europeana.eu%2Fschemas%2Fedm%2F%3E%0D%0APREFIX+ore%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.openarchives.org%2Fore%2Fterms%2F%3E%0D%0ASELECT+*%0D%0AWHERE+%7B%0D%0A%3Fs+%3Fp+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fdata.europeana.eu%2Fitem%2F2022608%2FNTM_NTM_UWP_23476%3E+.%0D%0A%7D%0D%0ALIMIT+100&should-sponge=grab-everything&format=text%2Fhtml&timeout=0&debug=on) endpoint. Supporting JSON-LD snippets as explained in this work would make the record API obsolete and more importantly, Open Data reusers would have a starting point for querying the SPARQL endpoint.

In future work, extending Comunica for harvesting Hydra collections would help organizations to improve their collection management. These collections could be defined on their main page of their website improving Open Data discoverability.

<!-- The cultural heritage website hetarchief.be showcases an official maintained paged collection of Linked Data Fragments about newspapers. By extending Comunica, in-depth data analysis and federated querying over this dataset is possible. To improve querying speed, Linked Data services ([SPARQL-endpoint](http://semanticweb.org/wiki/SPARQL_endpoint.html), [HDT](cite:cites Fernndez2013BinaryRR) file, TPF interface...) with a higher maintenance cost can be created on top of JSON-LD snippets. Such interfaces would suffer from scalability problems: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) texts have bad compression rates, and thus require gigabytes of disk space. With our solution, these OCR-text are published in a seperate document keeping the maintenance cost low while harvesting in an automated way is still possible. By using our demonstrator, non-technical users are able to extract a data dump from an enriched website. -->

<!-- To gain traction with an international audience, e.g. the science stories platform ([http://sciencestories.io](http://sciencestories.io)), a reconciliation service could be created with knowledge bases (cfr. Wikidata). 
Next to embedding the data, hypermedia controls or search engine optimization features, also the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/) (IIIF) Image API for sharing images could be described within a JSON-LD snippet for raising the discoverability of this service. IIIF API information already uses JSON-LD to describe its features such as tiling and licensing which makes this an excellent snippet addition helping an organization become more visible on the Web. -->

<!--In future work, extending Comunica for harvesting Hydra collections would help organizations to improve their collection management. These collections could be defined on their main page of their website improving Open Data discoverability. Also work on supporting multiple views acting as indexes for collections would benefit querying performance on sorting or filtering operations on e.g. geospatial or temporal data.-->
